Current e-commerce:
We shop from an online ecommerce platform and we go through different items we want to purchase like we are reading a book we enter keyword and visit a single page with different images. Like we search for a word in glossary and then we go to its page number and get what we are seeking for. It shows current e-commerce system limitize us to only a book.

My Idea:
Innovation I want to bring in ecommerce is to build a website in VR, where user will feel like he is shopping in real world instead of going through book pages. Everything will be 3d modeled similarly like real world outlet store.
A good example if one has played GTA vice city, in that game there was a mission where Tom had to kill some people in a Shopping mall Shopping mall was a VR 3D model people (3d models) were shopping in outlets outlets were stuffed with 3d models dummies etc.
