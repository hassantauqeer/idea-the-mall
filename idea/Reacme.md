Abstract:
The core idea is to create a shopping mall (like Centaurus here in Islamabad) in virtual reality (VR) accessible from any web browser so that consumers can perform the same activities in the virtual mall as in a real-world mall. These would include shopping - checking out and purchasing items in virtual reality, as well as advertising and promotion. 

Current e-commerce:
We currently shop from online e-commerce platforms and browse through different items we want to purchase it all feels like we are reading a book. In current e-commerce websites we enter keywords and visit a single page with different images, like searching for a word in the glossary of a book and then going to its page number to find what we are looking for. As we can see, the current e-commerce system is limited in function interface it is not much more than reading a book.

Innovation: The Maall

The innovation that I want to bring to e-commerce is to build a website in VR, where the user will feel like he is shopping in the real world instead of going through a one-dimensional catalog. Everything will be 3D modeled similarly to a physical storefront. 

 A good example is if one has played Grand Theft Auto Vice City, in that game there was a mission where Tom had to kill some people in a shopping mall. The shopping mall was a VR 3D model where people (3d models) were shopping in outlets that were filled with 3D models, dummies, etc. Some screenshots from that mission of the game:
  







Shopping Mall:
What my actual idea is is to develop a (retail) shopping mall (plaza) in VR similar to what is in this game’s screenshots. Where I will sell stores (shops) to different buyers, buyers could be outlets like Levis etc, or any other shop can be built in that store similar to a real world center including stores for electrical appliances, clothes, shoes, Apple, Samsung, car showrooms., As this would be a VR store, we could even build a showroom for cars, helicopters, airplanes, or anything else that comes new onto the market, and we can display it in one of our stores from our shopping mall for promotion, and advertisement purposes that are impossible in real world malls. We can also earn a lot from these promotions.

Shop:
Each Shop/store will have following properties:
•	It’ll have a specific length and width (40*40) feet etc.
•	A new Room/Store will be completely empty during its selling time.
•	Price of store will vary according to its location in Mall, like corner shop, or 1st floor shop etc will have higher rates.

 How we can earn through Mall:
•	By Selling/Renting shops/stores in the Mall.
•	By advertisement and promotion for different products and companies.
•	By commissions from sale and purchase of products.
•	By providing different models to stores/shops, designing stores for store owners for their product. Example: If Levis buys a store in a shopping mall, at the time of purchase they only get a room that is completely empty, then they pay interior designers to design their store;, similarly, when we sell/rent a store we will also provide them the option to help design their store and we can earn from this as well.
•	By opening meeting rooms for different teams. Example: suppose a team of some businessmen/developers want to conduct a meeting, unlike conventional ways of meeting such as a video conference call, we can innovate by getting their photos from their cameras and then putting them on the faces of different models and showing them all in the full room where everyone is sitting, and to them it will be like they are all present in the same room and attending a real world meeting. 
 Integration of Blockchain
Blockchain technology was basically developed to gain trust of people. We can use Smart Contracts to deal with selling and purchasing in Mall either it is items from a store or Shops/stores themselves.
Currently I’m willing to develop two tokens 
•	Basic Shop Token (BST)
•	Access Shop Token(AST)

Basic Shop Token (BST)
BST will be used for selling and purchasing purpose of shops and items/accessories they are selling to customer/buyers.

Access Shop Token (AST)
AST is a unique token for each single shop, Every shop In mall will have it’s own unique identifier Token that can be transferred to any buyer (new owner) of shop.
Area of shop (40*40 feet) will automatically increase as the shop ages. Suppose a shop will be increased from (40*40) to (45*45) after a passing 1 year of its creation. This will be a benefit for customers(shop owners/buyers), and obviously it’ll not affect us anyway because it is built in VR and we can increase its area whenever we want to without paying for area cost like in real-world.
Initial Investment:
I’m willing to get an initial investment so I can build a good prototype of form maybe 2,3 full functional floors of Mall and to make a better team of developers, advisors, and marketing persons. Because this team matters a lot in ICO.
ICO
After getting initial investment and creating a good team. Next plan is to Run an ICO with 3-4 phases.
Why I prefer ICO for our product?
As from start ICOs helped many teams to collect incredible amount of investment for their products. 
But there were some cases due to which people usually don’t want to invest/trust in ICOs reasosn are:
•	Most of the ICOs didn’t delivered what they promised for before ICO.
•	A few of them were scam, with an impressive landing page and fake teams many people looted  a lot of investors.
•	But that was all due to hype of ICOs that made investors throw their money blindly in greed.
But with all these facts I still want to go for an ICO because.
•	1st thing is it can help gather a lot of investment, if we have some famous and top/ better advisors in our team, because usually investors invest by seeing team and hype
